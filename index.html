        <p>Hey guys! My name is Mitchel Hunter. I love hiking and photography. My favorite places are in the mountians and next to waterfalls. If I'm out there, I probably have a camera with me. I find joy in bringing the beauty of this world to others through photos.</p>
        <p>When I look at a photo, my first thought is always about what I am feeling. Does it make me feel anything? In my opinion, art should always stir up something in the viewer. It doesn't matter a whole lot what it is so long as the viewer feels something.</p>
        <p>I have lived with depression for most of my adult life. During those lows, art is something that has helped me through it. When I feel numb, sometimes a photo, song, or painting can reach into me and help me remember what it feels like to be alive again.</p>

        <p>Utah is a place of wonder and is unique in its capacity to have so many varying climates and environments. From forest covered mountains to dry rocky deserts and from waterfalls to salt flats, Utah offers anything an outdoor enthusiast could want.</p>
